# bible-connector

I have discovered two areas that lack technology: 1) there is no single bible API that provides access to all common translations (at least in English I believe because of copyrights), and 2) there is not already a comprehensive NuGet package to bring multiple translations/APIs together. The goal of this .NET library/package is to be able to interface many different bible APIs ([ESV](https://scripture.api.bible), [API.Bible](https://scripture.api.bible), etc.) to return standardized models and interact with books/chapters/verses with standardized functions. Since this is simply a library of code and not an active/deployed REST API in itself, the user still needs to provide their own keys and authorization for each of the APIs supported.
